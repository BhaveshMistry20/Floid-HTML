# Floid - HTML

I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks You!

## Tech stack & Libraries/Versions.

I've to create the template using the following libraries and versions that are given below (and that all I've using the CDN files):-

- Bootstrap-5.2.2
- Font Awesome-5.10.0
- slick-carousel-1.8.1
- parallax.js-3.1.0
- jquery-3.6.1

And also I've used the SASS/SCSS Structure for the template or its Variables. So you see my structure for better understand.

Simple Structure
If you’re using Sass on a small project, for example - a single web page. A very minimal structure could be as follows:

```
* _components.scss
* _layout.scss
* _pages.scss
* styles.scss
```

Here we have 3 partials connecting up to our styles.scss.

Components: anything reusable such as variables, typography, buttons, animations, fonts, radio buttons, dropdownlists etc.

Layout: contains all the CSS that handles the layout, such as the header and any custo sliders systems.

Pages: contained within this file are all your pages details.

Main: it should ONLY contain the imports for the above files.

## Project setup guidelines

1. Git clone or download the project files.
2. To start a local server and watch for files & changes.
3. Have fun developing!

### What I liked

- I liked the project design.
- Color Combinations.

### What I didn’t like

- I didn't like buttons design.
- Maximum 1-2 fonts you can use, don't use more than 2 fonts used for this

### Where I faced issues

- To add the positions of images in the parallax section..

## Estimated time

I took 48 hours for this because I took more time in to set the parallax design in the Real Life section.

## What is pending from my side

Responsiveness for the Real Life section.
